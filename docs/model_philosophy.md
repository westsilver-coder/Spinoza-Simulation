Philosophical Foundations of the Simulation

This simulation is inspired by:

1. Spinoza’s Conatus Theory

Every being strives to persevere in its existence.

Conatus is modeled numerically as:

Conatus = (Joy - Sadness / Resilience) + BaseVitality


Resilience is derived from Reason.

2. Affects (정서)

Two fundamental affects are used:

Joy → Increase in power of acting

Sadness → Decrease in power of acting

Their interaction forms all emotional dynamics.

3. Reason as Regulation

Spinoza argues:

Reason moderates the affects and helps individuals maintain stability.

Thus:

Higher reason → better recovery

Reduced sadness impact

Stronger resilience

4. Social Relations

Based on Spinoza's notion of:

“We seek what increases our power of acting and avoid what diminishes it.”

In the model:

Positive interaction → Joy transfer → Affinity increases

Negative interaction → Sadness increase → Affinity decreases

Relationship memory persists

5. External Events as Collective Affect Shocks

Events represent societal-level affects:

Event	Philosophical Interpretation
Disaster	collective sadness & fear
Boom	collective joy / empowerment
Epidemic	reduced recovery, fragility
Innovation	increased efficiency, reason-like empowerment
