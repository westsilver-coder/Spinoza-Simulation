Event System Design

This document explains how global events change system dynamics.

1. Event Streak System

If the same event happens consecutively:

Multiplier = 1.0 + 0.3 * (streak - 1)


Meaning:

Disaster three times in a row → catastrophic

Boom three times in a row → golden age

2. Event Effects
🌪 Disaster

Joy sharply reduced

Sadness increased

Population recovery slows

📈 Boom

Joy increases

Sadness partially removed

☣ Epidemic

Global recovery rate reduced permanently

💡 Innovation

Global metabolism reduced → more stability

Similar to increased rational efficiency in society

3. Capacity Modification (Birth Rate Influence)

Events temporarily modify population capacity:

Event	Capacity
Boom	+20%
Innovation	+20%
Disaster	-40%
Epidemic	-40%

This affects logistic birth rates.

4. Visualization Mapping

Boom → Green text

Disaster → Red

Epidemic → Orange
